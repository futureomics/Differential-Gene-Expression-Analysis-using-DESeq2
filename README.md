# Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-using-DESeq2
This repository contains R scripts and guidance for performing Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) package. It is designed to help researchers identify significantly differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data.
